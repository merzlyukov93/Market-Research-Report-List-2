<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ion Selective Permeation Resin Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Per-Fluorinated</li><li>Non-Fluorinated</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Ion Selective Permeation Resin market can be categorized into two main types: Per-Fluorinated and Non-Fluorinated. Per-Fluorinated resins are specifically designed to have a high fluorine content, which enhances their ion selectivity and permeation properties. These resins are commonly used in applications where high chemical resistance and stability are required. On the other hand, Non-Fluorinated resins do not contain fluorine and offer a different set of properties. They are often preferred in applications where cost-effectiveness and lower chemical resistance are acceptable compromises.</p></p>
