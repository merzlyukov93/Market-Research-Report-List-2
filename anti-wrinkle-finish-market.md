<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Anti-wrinkle Finish Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>

<p><p>The anti-wrinkle finish market can be categorized into two types: active silicone and inactive silicone. Active silicone products contain active ingredients that actively work to reduce wrinkles by stimulating collagen production and improving skin elasticity. On the other hand, inactive silicone products do not have active ingredients but rather provide a temporary smoothing effect by filling in fine lines and wrinkles.
