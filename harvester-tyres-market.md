<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Harvester Tyres Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Radial Agriculture Tires</li><li>Bias (Crossply) Agriculture Tires</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Harvester tires are predominantly classified into two types, namely Radial Agriculture Tires and Bias (Crossply) Agriculture Tires. Radial agriculture tires are designed with layers of steel belts running across the tire at 90 degrees to the direction of travel, resulting in better traction, reduced soil compaction, and improved fuel efficiency. In contrast, bias (crossply) agriculture tires have cords that run at an angle to the direction of travel, making them sturdy, resistant to punctures, and suitable for rough terrains. These tire types cater to different farming needs and provide unique benefits to harvester vehicles.</p></p>
